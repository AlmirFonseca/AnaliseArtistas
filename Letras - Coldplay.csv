(Let somebody, let somebody go)

We had a kind of love
I thought that it would never end
Oh, my lover, oh, my other, oh, my friend
We talked around in circles and
We talked around and then
I loved you to the moon and back again
You gave everything this golden glow
Now turn off all the stars 'cause this I know
That it hurts like so
To let somebody go

All the storms we weathered
Everything that we went through
Now without you, what on earth am I to do?
When I called the mathematicians and
I asked them to explain
They said love is only equal to the pain
And when everything was going wrong
You could turn my sorrow into song

Oh, it hurts like so
To let somebody go
To let somebody go (Body go)
Oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Oh, oh-oh
(Let somebody, let somebody go)

Oh, oh-oh (Oh), when you love somebody (Oh)

Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last, last

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through, through

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

And I've got some issues no one else can see
All these emotions pouring out of me

We fell in through the clouds
And everyone before us is there, welcoming us now
It's the end of death and doubt
And loneliness is out
Coloratura
The place we dreamed about
The melodies inside yourself and love come pouring out
And everyone's allowed
We're feathered by the crowd
And up there in the heavеns
Galileo and those pining for the moon
Know it's a slow burn
Through Pioneer and Hеlix
Oumuamua, Heliopause and Neptune
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll get there, so for now
In this crazy world, I do
I just want you

In the end, it's all about
The love you're sending out

And up there in the heavens
The explorers who've all gathered by balloon
Saw the world turn
Through Voyager, Callisto
Calliope, Betelgeuse, the Neon Moons
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll touch down soon, so will you

Christmas night, another fight
Tears, we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet, to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world


It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

We fell in through the clouds
And everyone before us is there, welcoming us now
It's the end of death and doubt
And loneliness is out
Coloratura
The place we dreamed about
The melodies inside yourself and love come pouring out
And everyone's allowed
We're feathered by the crowd
And up there in the heavеns
Galileo and those pining for the moon
Know it's a slow burn
Through Pioneer and Hеlix
Oumuamua, Heliopause and Neptune
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll get there, so for now
In this crazy world, I do
I just want you

In the end, it's all about
The love you're sending out

And up there in the heavens
The explorers who've all gathered by balloon
Saw the world turn
Through Voyager, Callisto
Calliope, Betelgeuse, the Neon Moons
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll touch down soon, so will you

Now, without you, what on earth am I to do?
When I called the mathematicians and

They said love is only equal to the pain
And when everything was going wrong

""A champion of the world""

Yeah
I tried my best to stay alight
Fly like a firework
I tried my best to stay in fight
But my rocket ship won't work
No, referee, don't stop the fight
Everyone can see I'm hurt
Still I'll stand before conquistadors
Till I'm champion of the world

And when I sail, I'm sailing west
Knowing I might fail, but still I'm hoping for the best
In in my dreams, onto my chest
She'll pin the colours and say:
""I wandered the whole wide world but
Baby, you're the best""

So I'm flying on my bicycle
Heading upwards from the Earth

From promises he'd made behind
Where there was no harvest
But he missed the sky and its circus
And countless, the stars

And beautifully wide
In Africa

And say, ""It's alright, child

If you could do it all again, would you do it all the same?
Is there something that you'd tell your former self?
There were those that wished they'd spun upon the jukebox
There were pirates who had never seen the sea
But the one recurring theme, the one recurring dream they had
Was to be whatever they wanted to be
""To be Pyotr Tchaikovsky
To be free, and like everyone else
There will be no flags to own me, no!
'Cause I just want to be myself""

Julie, telephoning by a ouija
""Is there any advice that you could give?
When you know you're not like them
Do you know La Varsovienne?
I know that I am living, but can you show me how to live?""

And the Holy Roman Army
Said, ""Your heart beats like everyone else""

I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
Achilles and his gold, Hercules and his gifts
Spider-Man's control, and Batman with his fists
Now clearly, I don't see myself upon that list

But she said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero, some fairy tale bliss
Just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss
I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Oh, I want something just like this
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo

Oh, I want something just like this
I want something just like this

I've been reading books of old, the legends and the myths
The testaments they told, the moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls a suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

She said, where'd you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody

Some superhero, some fairy tale bliss

I'm sorry, but I don't want to be an emperor. That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world, there's room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. The kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure!
A wonderful adventure!

Oh, I think I landed
In a world I hadn't seen
When I'm feeling ordinary
When I don't know what I mean

Oh, I think I landed
Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds
Saying it's true, it's not what it seems
Leave your broken windows open
And in the light just streams
You get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
Into life, I’ve just been woken
With a head full, a head full of dreams

Oh, I think I landed

Now you've got me open-handed

I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
But I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning sees another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
Heaven is in sight
Yeah, woo, woo, ooh
I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating, pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart

As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking into
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony
Every tear's a waterfall

And I should, but I can't let you go

But when I’m cold, cold
Yeah, when I'm cold, cold
There's a light that you give me when I’m in shadow
There's a feeling within me of everglow
Like brothers in blood, or sisters who ride
Yeah, we swore on that night, we'd be friends 'til we die
But the changing of winds, and the way waters flow
Life is short as the falling of snow
And now, I'm gonna miss you, I know

But when I'm cold, cold
In water rolled, salt
I know you're always with me and the way you will show
You're with me wherever I go
But you give me this feeling, this everglow

What I wouldn’t give for just a moment to hold
Because I live for this feeling, this everglow

So if you love someone, you should let them know
Oh, the light that you give me will everglow

God is watching me
God is, God don’t praise me because I beat Joe Frazier
God don't give nothin’ 'bout Joe Frazier
God don't care nothing about England or America as far as real wealth, it's all His

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own
I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
And people couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait for my head on a silver plate
I'm just a puppet on a lonely string
Whoa, for who would ever want to be king?

Turn your magic on, to me, she'd say
""Everything you want’s a dream away""
Under this pressure, under this weight
Oh, we are diamonds
And I feel my heart beating
I feel my heart underneath my skin
I feel my heart beating
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm alive again
Alive again
Oh, you make me feel
Like I'm alive again

Said I can't go on, not in this way
I'm a dream that died by light of day
I'm gonna hold up half the sky and say
Only I own me

This being human is a guest house
Every morning, a new arrival
A joy, a depression, a meanness
Some momentary awareness comes
As an unexpected visitor
Welcome and entertain them all
Even if they are a crowd of sorrows
Who violently sweep your house empty of its furniture
Still, treat each guest honorably
He may be clearing you out for some new delight
The dark thought, the shame, the malice
Meet them at the door laughing and invite them in
Be grateful for whoever comes
Because each has been sent as a guide from beyondYou might also likeEmbed"

Fixing up a car to drive in it again
Searching for the water, hoping for the rain
Up and up, up and up
Down upon the canvas, working meal to meal
Waiting for a chance to pick your orange field
Up and up, up and up
I see a pearl form, a diamond in the rough
See a bird soaring high above the flood
It's in your blood, It's in your blood
Underneath the storm, an umbrella is singing
Sitting with the poison takes away the pain
Up and up, up and up, it's saying
We’re gonna get it, get it together right now
Gonna get it, get it together somehow
Gonna get it, get it together and flower
Oh, ah
We’re gonna get it, get it together, I know
Gonna get it, get it together and flow
Gonna get it, get it together and go
Up, and up, and up

Lying in the gutter, aiming for the moon
Trying to empty out the ocean with a spoon
Up and up, up and up
Saying, how come people suffer? How come people part?
How come people struggle? How come people break your heart?
Break your heart?
Yes, I wanna know, show me how to feel
Yes, I wanna grow, show me how to heal it up
Heal it up
See the forest there in every seed
Angels in the marble waiting to be freed
Just need love, just need love

My father said never give up son
Just look how good Cassius become
Muhammad, Mahatma, and Nelson
Not scared to be strong

“What if they say I’m no good? What if they say ""Get out of here, kid. You got no future?”

Now you could run and just say they’re right
No, I’ll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say, ""No, wait, they're wrong""
And get to keep on dancing all life long
My father said never give up son
Just look what Amelia and Joan done
Oh Rosa, Teresa their war won
Not scared to be strong

Now you could run and just say they’re right
No I’ll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait, they’re wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long

Yeah you could be someone special
You've got bright in your brains and lightning in your veins
You'll go higher than they've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got fire in your eyes and when you realize you'll go further than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k, but I’m trying to turn k’s to m’s, what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world


It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)

Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Where there are miracles at work
For the thirst and for the hunger
Come the conference of birds

And in the light just streams
And you get a head, a head full of dreams
You can see the change you wanted
Be what you want to be
And you get a head, a head full of dreams

Been standing in the corner, studying the lights
The dreaming of escape will keep you up at night
But someone had put the flares up and got me in the rays
So I guess I’d better stay
‘Uh uh no come on’ you say

It's a fools gold thunder
It's just a warring rain
Don't let the fears just start 'What if
I won’t see you again’
Around here you never want to sleep all night
So start falling in love, start the riot and
Come on rage with me
We don’t need words
And we’ll be birds
Got to make our own key

Only got this moment
You and me
Guilty of nothing, but geography

Come on and raise it
Come on and raise this noise for the million people
Who got not one voice
Come on it’s not over if you mean it, say loud
Come on all for love, out from the underground

Away with me
We don’t need words
Close your eyes and see
And we'll be birds, flying free
Holding on in the mystery

Specter of the wrong curse
A thorn without a rose
Something people fear
Yeah

And every time I thought I walked through walls
It’s all becoming clear
What's the point in feeling love for you
When you don't believe I'm here?
What's the point in saying ""Rescue me!""
If no one ever hears?

Written in graffiti on a bridge in a park
""Do you ever get the feeling that you’re missing the mark?""
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
Written up in marker on a factory sign:
""I struggle with the feeling that my life isn’t mine""
It's so cold, it's so cold
It's so cold, it's so cold
See the arrow they shot trying to tear us apart
Took the fire from my belly and the beat from my heart
Still, I won’t let go
Still, I won’t let go
Of you
'Cause you do
Oh, you use your heart as a weapon
And it hurts like heaven
On every street, every car, every surface, a name
Tonight, the streets are ours
And we’re writing and saying
""Don’t let 'em take control""
No, we won’t let 'em take control
Yes, I feel a little bit nervous
Yes, I feel nervous and I cannot relax
How come they’re out to get us?
How come they’re out when they don’t know the facts?
So on a concrete canvas under cover of dark
On a concrete canvas, I’ll go making my mark
Armed with a spray can soul
I’ll be armed with a spray can soul
And you
Oh, you

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world


It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name

Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
Bring back the water, let your ships roll in
In my heart, she left a hole
The tightrope that I’m walking just sways and ties
The Devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in

And sing
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world
Like a river to a raindrop, I lost a friend
My drunken hazard Daniel in a lion's den
And tonight, I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don’t let go
And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
Lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain, saying

Slow it down

It was a long and dark December, from the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember from the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured by a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?
Was a long and dark December when the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor when I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

If you love me
Won't you let me know?


I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship would stow
Far below

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still

Oh, morning come bursting the clouds, amen
Lift off this blindfold, let me see again
Bring back the water, let your ships roll in
In my heart, she left a hole
The tightrope that I’m walking just sways and ties
The Devil as he's talking with those angel's eyes
And I just want to be there when the lightning strikes
And the saints go marching in

And sing
Slow it down
Through chaos as it swirls
It's us against the world
Like a river to a raindrop, I lost a friend
My drunken hazard Daniel in a lion's den
And tonight, I know it all has to begin again
So whatever you do, don’t let go
And if we could float away
Fly up to the surface and just start again
Lift off before trouble just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us in the rain
Just erodes us and see roses in the rain, saying

I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And Heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart
As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking in to
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony

And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh

Is a, is a waterfall

Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still, I'll raise the flag

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world


It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face, and I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face, and I

And ignite your bones

I turn the music up, I got my records on
I shut the world outside until the lights come on
Maybe the streets alight, maybe the trees are gone
I feel my heart start beating to my favorite song
And all the kids they dance, all the kids all night
Until Monday morning feels another life
I turn the music up, I'm on a roll this time
And Heaven is in sight

I turn the music up, I got my records on
From underneath the rubble, sing a rebel song
Don't want to see another generation drop
I'd rather be a comma than a full stop
Maybe I'm in the black, maybe I'm on my knees
Maybe I'm in the gap between the two trapezes
But my heart is beating and my pulses start
Cathedrals in my heart
As we saw, oh, this light
I swear you, emerge blinking in to
To tell me it's alright
As we soar walls
Every siren is a symphony

And every tear's a waterfall
Is a waterfall, oh
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh
Is a, is a waterfall
Every tear
Is a waterfall, oh-oh-oh

So you can hurt, hurt me bad
But still, I'll raise the flag

Oh, it was a wa-wa-wa-wa-waterfall

The wreckage of a universe floats past
Somewhere up above my heart
A tiny little seed is sown, a government is overthrown
Who knows when we'll be coming home at last
And I heard it on the radio that one day we'll be living in the stars
And I heard it on a TV show that somewhere up above and in my heart
They'll be tearing us apart, maybe moving us to Mars
We won't see the earth again
And the seconds just remain unchanged

8 to 9, 9 to 10
We are meeting for the first time
We might never meet again, you and me
We are meeting for the first time can't you see?

Nothing could be better

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world


It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day, we are gonna get out

At night they would go walking 'til the breaking of the day
The morning is for sleeping
Through the dark streets they go searching to see God in their own way
Save the nighttime for your weeping
Your weeping

Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay
So we rode down to the river where Victorian ghosts pray
For their curses to be broken
We go wander 'neath the arches where the witches are and they say
""There are ghost towns in the ocean""
The ocean

Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay


God is in the houses and God is in my head
And all the cemeteries of London
I see God come in my garden but I don’t know what he said
For my heart it wasn’t open
Not open

Now my back's on the line, my back's on the ropes

But night makes a fool of us in the daylight

There we were dying of frustration

But it’s not easy when she turns you on
Sin, stay gone
If you’d only, if you’d only say yes
Whether you will's anybody’s guess
God, only God knows I'm trying my best
But I’m just so tired of this loneliness

Hey!

So up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop then they let go
Dizzily screaming ""Let the windows down!""

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world


It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'

It was a long and dark December, from the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember from the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured by a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?
Was a long and dark December when the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor when I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

If you love me
Won't you let me know?


I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship would stow
Far below

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?

Scared of losing all the time
He wrote it in a letter
He was a friend of mine
He heard you could see your future
Inside a glass of water
The ripples and the lines
And he asked
""Will I see heaven in mine?""
That is just the way it was
Nothing could be better
And nothing ever was
Oh, they say you can see your future
Inside a glass of water
The riddles and the rhymes
Will I see heaven in mine?
Oh, oh, oh
Son, don't ask
Neither half full nor empty
Is your glass
Cling to the mast
Spend your whole life living
In the past
Going nowhere fast

So he wrote it on a wall
The hollowest of halos
Is no halo at all
Television selling plastic
Figurines of leaders
Saying nothing at all
And you chime, Stars in heaven align
Oh, oh, oh

Then there was rain
The sky wore a veil of gold and green
Night was the bride of a lonely day
Time just floated
Then there was rain
The sound foundations are crumbling
To the ground comes a pyramid tumbling
Time just floated away
We can watch it and stay and we can listen
Oh, rainy day, come round
Sometimes I just want it to slow down
And we're separated now
I'm down
But I love it when you come over to the house
I love it when you come over to my house

Then there was rain
And I spent the night with the Queen of Spain
My lonely little heart, well it broke again
Time so vicious
Singing, the deeper that the knife goes in the more you win
You end up with less than when you begin
The deeper that the knife goes in

Drums, here it comes
Don't you wish that life could be as simple
As fish swimming round in a barrel?
When you've got the gun
Oh when I run, here it comes
We're just two little figures in a soup bowl
Trying to get behind a kind of control

Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay
And the night over London lay


God is in the houses and God is in my head
And all the cemeteries of London
I see God come in my garden but I don’t know what he said
For my heart it wasn’t open
Not open

Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay

Singing la-la-la-la-la-la-lay

Doesn't mean I'm lost
Doesn't mean I'll stop
Doesn't mean I'm across

Just because I'm hurting
Doesn't mean I'm hurt
Doesn't mean I didn't get what I deserved
No better and no worse
I just got lost
Every river that I tried to cross
Every door I ever tried was locked
Oh and I'm just waiting till the shine wears off

You might be a big fish
In a little pond
Doesn't mean you've won
'Cause along may come a bigger one

And you'll be lost
Every river that you tried to cross
Every gun you ever held went off

Lovers, keep on the road you're on
Runners until the race is run
Soldiers, you've got to soldier on
Sometimes even the right is wrong

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day we're gonna get out
Tonight maybe we're gonna run
Dreaming of the Osaka sun
Oh, oh, dreaming of when the morning comes

They are turning my head out
To see what I'm all about
Keeping my head down
To see what it feels like now
But I have no doubt
One day the sun will come out


One, two, three!

Reign of love, I can't let go
To the sea I offer this heavy load
Locust wind, lift me up
I'm just a prisoner in a reign of love
Locust wind, here I stop
How I wish I'd spoken up to a reign of love

When it started we had high hopes
Now my back's on the line, my back's on the ropes
When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool of us in the daylight

There we were dying of frustration
Saying, ""Lord lead me not into temptation""
But it’s not easy when she turns you on
Sin, stay gone
If you’d only, if you’d only say yes
Whether you will's anybody’s guess
God, only God knows I'm trying my best
But I’m just so tired of this loneliness

Hey!

So up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop then they let go
Dizzily screaming ""Let the windows down!""
As I crumble to the ground

If you'd only if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world


It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)

It was a long and dark December, from the rooftops I remember
There was snow, white snow
Clearly I remember from the windows they were watching
While we froze down below
When the future's architectured by a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?
Was a long and dark December when the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor when I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

If you love me
Won't you let me know?


I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship would stow
Far below

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

Oh no, I see
A spider web is tangled up with me
And I lost my head
And thought of all the stupid things I'd said

Oh no, what's this?
A spider web, and I'm caught in the middle
So I turned to run
And thought of all the stupid things I'd done
And I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
And oh no, I never meant to do you harm

Oh no, I see
A spider web, and it's me in the middle
So I twist and turn
But here am I in my little bubble

Singing that I, I never meant to cause you trouble
And I, I never meant to do you wrong
And I, well, if I ever caused you trouble
Oh no, I never meant to do you harm

Says it's a stupid thing to do
I have your love on call
And yet my belly is so full
There might be nothing left to do
So I ran away from you

I'm gonna come on in, my eyes were closed
I can feel it near, the sides so close
I'm gonna come on out and burn the sky

I stuck in line, and in a cage

What if there was no light?
Nothing wrong, nothing right?
What if there was no time?
And no reason or rhyme?
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?

What if I got it wrong?
And no poem or song
Could put right what I got wrong
Or make you feel I belong
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there by your side?
That you don't want me there in your life?
Oooooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side
Oooooh, that's right
How can you know it if you don't even try?
Oooooh, that's right

Every step that you take
Could be your biggest mistake
It could bend or it could break
But that's the risk that you take
What if you should decide
That you don't want me there in your life?
That you don't want me there by your side?

Oooooh, that's right
Let's take a breath, jump over the side

Was letting go not taking part

The parting of the seas
But you mean more, mean more to me
Than any color I can see

All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or up as us
As us
You see the world in black and white
Not painted right
You see no meaning to your life
You should try
You should try

All you ever wanted was love
But you never looked hard enough
It's never gonna give itself up
All you ever wanted to be
Living in perfect symmetry
Nothing is as down or up as us

And don't you wanna see it come soon
Floating in a big white balloon
Or given on your own silver spoon
Don't you wanna see it come down
There for throwing your arms around
And say ""you're not a moment too soon""

Was letting go not taking part
Was the hardest part
And the strangest thing
Was waiting for that bell to ring
It was the strangest start

I could feel it go down
Bittersweet I could taste in my mouth
Silver lining the clouds
Oh and I
I wish that I could work it out
And the hardest part
Was letting go not taking part
You really broke my heart, oh
And I tried to sing
But I couldn't think of anything
And that was the hardest part, oh, oh

I can feel it go down
You left the sweetest taste in my mouth
You're a silver lining the clouds
Oh and I
Oh and I
I wonder what it's all about
I wonder what it's all about

Everything I know is wrong
Everything I do, it just comes undone
And everything is torn apart

And kept me for yourself

And I could write a song

Well, that's where I belong
And you belong with me
And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost, and then get found
Or swallowed in the sea
You put me on a line
And hung me out to dry
And darling, that's when I
Decided to go see
You cut me down to size
And opened up my eyes
Made me realize
What I could not see

And I could write a book
The one they'll say that shook
The world, and then it took
It took it back from me
And I could write it down
Or spread it all around
Get lost, and then get found
And you'll come back to me

How long do I have to climb

Is a chance you seize
How long am I gonna stand
With my head stuck under the sand?
I'll start before I can stop
Before I see things the right way up

Birds came flying from the underground

All the inventors could never design

Or a light that I couldn't see

Who fight one another
Will mourn and deceive us
Will find us and keep us
Take us or leave us
How soon is now?
Only how long is never?

The cardboard head I see
Has found its way to me

I'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated
Oh no

What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear you say to me, ""It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear and the things from which you can't escape""
Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others
Oh no

What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear you say to me, ""It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear and the things which you cannot explain""

And it's making me cry love
And it's making me cry

Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep
I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me
But I wake up
Yes I wake up smiling

Sometimes I feel, oh, the charge is surprising
Surprisingly good to be moving around
So I wake up
Yes I wake up smiling
So what? I feel fine
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life
I'm alright, I feel good
So I'll go, and I'll try to stop moving

Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep
But I've got to get going, so much that I'm wanting to do
But I wake up smiling

And this could be my last chance
Of saving my innocence
And this could be my last chance
No more keeping my feet on the ground

Sometimes I feel, oh, the charge is surprising
Surprisingly good to be moving around
