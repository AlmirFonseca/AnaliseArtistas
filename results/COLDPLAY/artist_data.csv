(Aside from all the medicine and health)
If you could do it all again, would you do it all the same?
Is there something that you'd tell your former self?
There were those that wished they'd spun upon the jukebox
There were pirates who had never seen the sea
But the one recurring theme, the one recurring dream they had
Was to be whatever they wanted to be
""To be Pyotr Tchaikovsky
To be free, and like everyone else
There will be no flags to own me, no!
'Cause I just want to be myself""

Julie, telephoning by a ouija
""Is there any advice that you could give?
When you know you're not like them
Do you know La Varsovienne?
I know that I am living, but can you show me how to live?""

And the Holy Roman Army
Said, ""Your heart beats like everyone else""
But you don't need no flags to tell you who you are, so say
""I just want to be myself''

That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible; Jew, Gentile, black man, white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. In this world, there's room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. The kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people, have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure!

Tanzaku stars, lasso the moon
And be standing there beside you
Right when the storm comes through

Cause I never say die, aim never untrue
Never so high as when I'm with you
And there isn't a fire that I wouldn't walk through
My army of one is gonna fight for you
My army of one is gonna fall for you, yeah

Cause you reign
All cause you reign
All cause you reign
My army of one is gonna call it through

Where making more friends would be easy
I wanna live where the sun comes out"

We had a kind of love
I thought that it would never end
Oh, my lover, oh, my other, oh, my friend
We talked around in circles and
We talked around and then
I loved you to the moon and back again
You gave everything this golden glow
Now turn off all the stars 'cause this I know
That it hurts like so
To let somebody go

All the storms we weathered
Everything that we went through
Now without you, what on earth am I to do?
When I called the mathematicians and
I asked them to explain
They said love is only equal to the pain
And when everything was going wrong
You could turn my sorrow into song

Oh, it hurts like so
To let somebody go
To let somebody go (Body go)
Oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Oh, oh-oh
(Let somebody, let somebody go)

Oh, oh-oh (Oh), when you love somebody (Oh)
When you love somebody (Oh)

Oh, oh-oh (Oh), when you love somebody (Oh)
When you love somebody (Oh)
Got to let somebody know

I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last, last

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through, through

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

And I've got some issues no one else can see
All these emotions pouring out of me
I got some issues no one else can see
All these emotions pouring out of me"

Fish fell out of water
Bird stuck on the ground
Chaos giving orders
Everything is upside down
The whole world on a flight path
I wonder where they'll go, ah
Trouble's on the outside, I know
But now, all I can think about is you
All I can think about is you
If all that I'm on earth to do
Is solo, then what a lone poor shoe
I want to walk in a two


Go!
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can
It's all I can do
It's all I can do


Everything is falling all around you
It's all I can do
All I can think about is you
It's all I can
All I can think about is you
Love is the only
Thing left that's true"

Just look how good Cassius become
Muhammad, Mahatma, and Nelson
Not scared to be strong

“What if they say I’m no good? What if they say ""Get out of here, kid. You got no future?”

Now you could run and just say they’re right
No, I’ll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say, ""No, wait, they're wrong""
And get to keep on dancing all life long
My father said never give up son
Just look what Amelia and Joan done
Oh Rosa, Teresa their war won
Not scared to be strong

Now you could run and just say they’re right
No I’ll never be no one in my whole life
Or you could turn and say no wait, they’re wrong
And get to keep on dancing all life long

Yeah you could be someone special
You've got bright in your brains and lightning in your veins
You'll go higher than they've ever gone
In you I see someone special
You've got fire in your eyes and when you realize you'll go further than we've ever gone
Just turn it on

Look I paid my intuition I couldn't afford tuition
My funds was insufficient, it felt like I'm in prison
Until I realized I had to set my mind free
I was trusting statistics more than I trust me
Get a degree, good job, 401k, but I’m trying to turn k’s to m’s, what does it take?
And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve"

Diamonds ate the radio
Moving in the dead of night
We took photographs just some just so

We were moving at the speed of flight

Kids cry
If you want to
That's alright
If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight
Just an alien

We were hovering without a home
Millions are UFO
Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says

Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line

Just an alien

Oh, we just want to get home again

Tell your leader
Sir or ma'am
We come in peace
We mean no harm
Somewhere out there
In the unknown
All the E.T.'s are phoning home"
