Spotify Singles;2022-02-23;1;Let Somebody Go (Spotify Singles);No;"(Let somebody, let somebody go)

We had a kind of love
I thought that it would never end
Oh, my lover, oh, my other, oh, my friend
We talked around in circles and
We talked around and then
I loved you to the moon and back again
You gave everything this golden glow
Now turn off all the stars 'cause this I know
That it hurts like so
To let somebody go

All the storms we weathered
Everything that we went through
Now without you, what on earth am I to do?
When I called the mathematicians and
I asked them to explain
They said love is only equal to the pain
And when everything was going wrong
You could turn my sorrow into song

Oh, it hurts like so
To let somebody go
To let somebody go (Body go)
Oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Oh, oh-oh
(Let somebody, let somebody go)

Oh, oh-oh (Oh), when you love somebody (Oh)
When you love somebody (Oh)
Got to let somebody know
Oh, oh-oh (Oh), when you love somebody (Oh)
When you love somebody (Oh)
Got to let somebody know
So when you love somebody
When you love somebody"
Spotify Singles;2022-02-23;2;Day ‘n’ Nite (Spotify Singles);No;"Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last, last

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through, through

'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

And I've got some issues no one else can see
All these emotions pouring out of me
I got some issues no one else can see
All these emotions pouring out of me"

Know it's a slow burn
Through Pioneer and Hеlix

But we'll get there, so for now
In this crazy world, I do
I just want you

In the end, it's all about
The love you're sending out

And up there in the heavens
The explorers who've all gathered by balloon
Saw the world turn
Through Voyager, Callisto
Calliope, Betelgeuse, the Neon Moons
We're a slow-burning tune
But we'll touch down soon, so will you

Infinity Station Sessions - EP;2021-12-02;5;Christmas Lights;No;"Christmas night, another fight
Tears, we cried a flood
Got all kinds of poison in
Of poison in my blood
I took my feet, to Oxford Street
Tryna right a wrong
Just walk away, those windows say
But I can't believe she's gone

When you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Up above candles on air flicker
Oh, they flicker and they float
But I'm up here holding on
To all those chandeliers of hope
Like some drunken Elvis singing
I go singing out of tune
Saying how I always loved you darling
And I always will

Oh, when you're still waiting for the snow to fall
Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all
Still waiting for the snow to fall
It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Down where the sea and city meet
May all your troubles soon be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on

Those Christmas lights
Light up the street
Maybe they'll bring her back to me
Then all my troubles will be gone
Oh, Christmas lights, keep shining on"
Live From Climate Pledge Arena (Amazon Original) - EP;2021-11-05;1;Viva la Vida;No;"I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world


It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word

And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
From now on, our troubles will be far away

And here we are, as In olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us

Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow

Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Every time she closed her eyes
Woo, ooh, ooh
Wahh, ahh, ooh

When she was just a girl
She expected the world
It flew away from her reach
The bullets catch in her teeth
Life goes on, it gets so heavy
The wheel breaks the butterfly
Every tear a waterfall
In the night, the stormy night, she'll close her eyes
In the night, the stormy night, away she'd fly

And dream of para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Para-para-paradise
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
She'd dream of para-para-paradise

How do we help each other?

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old King is dead, long live the King
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
That was when I ruled the world

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
And people couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait for my head on a silver plate
I'm just a puppet on a lonely string
Whoa, for who would ever want to be king?

And maybe I could be the new Ali of music prolly
Instead of doing it just as a hobby like these boys told me to
I guess you either watch the show or you show and prove
Prove it to them or you prove it to yourself  but honestly it's better if you do it for yourself
Never complacent till we hit the oasis
One life don't waste it feel my heart races, success I taste it, ah
We on the verge of getting every single thing that we deserve"

If you want to
Hold me
Hold me tight

We were hovering without a home

Hovering in hope some scope tonight
Sees the light and says

Fly if you want to
That's alright
But if you want to
Call me
Call this line

Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word

It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums

And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)

People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world"

While we froze down below
When the future's architectured by a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?
Was a long and dark December when the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God

And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor when I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship would stow

If I lost it all
Or fell into the trap
Then she'd call

When you're tired of racing and you
Found you never left the start
Come on, baby, don’t let it break your heart
Though heavily we bled
Still, on we crawl
Trying to catch a cannonball
And a slow burning tide
Through my veins is flowing
From my shipwreck, I heard her call
And she sang

When you're tired of aiming your arrows
Still, you never hit the mark, oh-oh
And even in your rains and shadows
Still, we're never gonna part, oh-oh
Come on, baby, don’t let it break your heart

Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

The break of day
Start again, I hear them say
It's so hard to just walk away
The birds they sang
All a choir
Start again, a little higher
It's a spark in a sea of grey

The sky is blue
Dreamed that lie 'til it's true
Then taking back the punch I threw
My arms turn wings
Oh, those clumsy things
Send me up to that wonderful world
And then, I'm up with the birds

Might have to go, where they don't know my name
Float all over the world just to see her again
But I won't show or feel any pain
Even though all my armor might rust in the rain

A simple plot
But I know, one day
Good things are coming our way
A simple plot
But I know, one day
Good things are coming our way

Now my back's on the line, my back's on the ropes
When it started we were alright
But night makes a fool of us in the daylight

There we were dying of frustration
Saying, ""Lord lead me not into temptation""
But it’s not easy when she turns you on
Sin, stay gone
If you’d only, if you’d only say yes
Whether you will's anybody’s guess
God, only God knows I'm trying my best
But I’m just so tired of this loneliness

Hey!

So up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop then they let go
Dizzily screaming ""Let the windows down!""
As I crumble to the ground

If you'd only if you'd only say yes
Whether you will's anybody's guess
God, only God knows she won't let me rest
But I'm just so tired of this loneliness

I've become so tired of this loneliness"

Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning, I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemies' eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand
I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world


It was the wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
And revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string (Mmm, mmm)
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield

While we froze down below
When the future's architectured by a carnival of idiots on show
You'd better lie low

If you love me
Won't you let me know?
Was a long and dark December when the banks became cathedrals
And a fox became God
Priests clutched onto Bibles hollowed out to fit their rifles
And a cross was held aloft
Bury me in armor when I'm dead and hit the ground
My nerves are poles that unfroze

If you love me
Won't you let me know?


I don't want to be a soldier
Who the captain of some sinking ship would stow
Far below

So if you love me
Why'd you let me go?

I took my love down to Violet Hill
There we sat in snow
All that time she was silent still
So if you love me, won't you let me know?
If you love me, won't you let me know?"

Whether you will's anybody’s guess
God, only God knows I'm trying my best
But I’m just so tired of this loneliness

Hey!

So up they picked me by the big toe
I was held from the rooftop then they let go
Dizzily screaming ""Let the windows down!""
As I crumble to the ground

Will find us and keep us
Take us or leave us

I can feel it near, the sides so close
I'm gonna come on out and burn the sky
A star arose in my own cage
I stuck in line, and in a cage
Just a single star I sing for

Everyone I know

Like this feeling you found
But just stay down
'Cause sometimes you'll feel
So stay down
Sometimes you feel

And it's me they're looking for
And it's me, I will never survive
But we'll be around so long

Brothers and sisters unite
It's the time of your lives
It's the time of your lives
Breakdown, breakdown
Got to spread love around
Got to spread it around
But just stay down

And sometimes you feel
So stay 'round
And sometimes you feel

And it's me they're looking for
And it's me, I will never survive
But we'll be around some long"

Brothers & Sisters - Single;1999-03-29;3;Only Superstition;No;"The cardboard head I see
Has found its way to me
It's old and it's old and it's old
Making me cry
I sleep but I will not move
I'm too scared to leave my room
But I won't be defeated
Oh no

What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear you say to me, ""It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear and the things from which you can't escape""
Keep clean for the thousandth time
Stand still and wait in line
Some numbers are better than others
Oh no

What if cards don't go my way?
And it's sure to spoil my day
But in voices loud and clear you say to me, ""It's only superstition
It's only your imagination
It's only all of the things that you fear and the things which you cannot explain""

And it's making me cry love
And it's making me cry
And I'm slipping away love
And I'm slipping away

It's only superstition, only your imagination
It's only superstition, only superstition"

Safety - EP;1998-05-25;2;No More Keeping My Feet on the Ground;No;"Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep
I think that maybe the curtains are closing on me
But I wake up
Yes I wake up smiling

Sometimes I feel, oh, the charge is surprising
Surprisingly good to be moving around
So I wake up
Yes I wake up smiling
So what? I feel fine
I'm OK, I've seen the lighter side of life
I'm alright, I feel good
So I'll go, and I'll try to stop moving

Sometimes I wake up, and I'm falling asleep
But I've got to get going, so much that I'm wanting to do
But I wake up smiling

And this could be my last chance
Of saving my innocence
And this could be my last chance
No more keeping my feet on the ground

Sometimes I feel, oh, the charge is surprising
Surprisingly good to be moving around
And I move
I wake up smiling

So what? I feel fine
I feel OK, I've seen the lighter side of life
I'm alright, I feel good
So I'll go, well it's time to stop moving"

For the opposing forces

B-Sides, Rarities and Demos;;1;Break of Dawn (Vampire Symphony);No;"A little drunk a little hurt inside
I went over to the forest
A little dope to start the open life
Felt obscure if I’m honest
I’m just a joke, just a punchline
That’s the will of the hunted
Just when I wanted to say no to life
She come in, and she’s on it
No, she said so
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
She said so
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
And then I saw the colours and I saw the light
Explode above us into shapes and lights
Last I was broken, come back to life
It was all, out of you
Woohoo!
Come on baby we can dance all night
I got a lust for livin’ and a thirst for life
And it’s love that you give me
Makes me feel alive when you do
What you do
I feel reborn
(Till the break of dawn, we’ll be buzzin on)
A little broke a little hurt inside
I don't know if I'm wanted
Like a candle in the dying light
She said “come on with the courage, don’t give up” singin'
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
No, she said so
Yeah yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)
